## Why math olympiads are a valuable experience for high schoolers

{% details Click here to know more %}

- The post by Evan Chen on [Lessons from math olympiads](https://blog.evanchen.cc/2018/01/05/lessons-from-math-olympiads/) is worth reading.
- In a previous post, titled [Against the “Research vs. Olympiads” Mantra](https://blog.evanchen.cc/2016/08/13/against-the-research-vs-olympiads-mantra/), Evan Chen discussed why math olympiads should not be judged by their relevance to research mathematics. He mentions that in that post, he failed to actually explain why he thinks math olympiads are a valuable experience for high schoolers. In the post [Lessons from math olympiads](https://blog.evanchen.cc/2018/01/05/lessons-from-math-olympiads/), he puts the amends. 
- and the last, but not the least, could be to take a look at the following [vision](https://imof.co/) of the [IMO Foundation](https://imof.co/), which is a charity supporting the International Mathematical Olympiad ([IMO](https://www.imo-official.org/)).

> It is the aim of the IMO to bring young people together from all over the world to enjoy the challenges of mathematics in a spirit of friendly competition. This provides a stimulus for Mathematics in each of the participating countries as young people strive for selection. Whist clearly it is a competitive event, for most participants, it is the people that they meet and the shared joy of discovery that is what they regard as most worthwhile. It is common that lifelong friendships are forged at IMO events.

## [Geoff Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoff_Smith_(mathematician))

is a British mathematician. He has been the [leader of the UK IMO team](https://www.imo-official.org/country_team_r.aspx?code=UNK) during 2002--2010, 2013--2018, 2022. He [has been awarded](https://www.imo-register.org.uk/golden-microphone.html) the IMO Golden Microphone thrice (during 2006, 2009, 2014).

## Goal of <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/">this website</a> (aka Why another website? What is its use?!)

{% details Click here to know %}

- To provide a brief introduction to Mathematical Olympiad.
- To serve as a website for the [MOPSS]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/MOPSS/) program at IISER Bhopal, to be held in person, from August 2024 to November 2024.
  - We have plans to post notes containing the details of those sessions. 
- To provide handouts on the topics of [Algebra]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/Algebra/), [Combinatorics]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/Combinatorics/), [Geometry]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/Geometry/), and [Number Theory]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/NumberTheory/), and to have them arranged across different sub-topics.
  - These notes may be helpful to the students who would like to have a look at some of the past RMO problems, in order to have an idea of the notions/topics involved, and/or to have a glimpse before getting started, or just curious about it. 
  - These notes may also be helpful to the students, who would like to prepare and would like to have the relevant questions organized across the topics and sub-topics.

## I am enthusiastic about math/math olympiads and/or teaching math to high schoolers. How may I contribute?

{% details Click here to know %}

- One may reach to schools, to high schoolers.
- One may explain about Olympiads, and spread awareness about it.
- One may encourage people (for instance, students, teachers or anyone enthusiastic/curious about math olympiad) to go through this website (and suggest a careful reading of the homepage!).
- Next, a student interested in math olympiad, may browse through the handouts posted here (this will grow with time).
- A person with passion in teaching high school students could use the handouts as a problem bag, or in other way.
- What else? For instance, if one has interest in a science subject(s) other than (or parallel to) mathematics, then one may refer to the [webpage of HBCSE](https://olympiads.hbcse.tifr.res.in/), which has information about olympiads ([past papers](https://olympiads.hbcse.tifr.res.in/how-to-prepare/past-papers/)) on the following subjects, and may repeat the same process as above adapted to those subjects!
  - Astronomy
  - Biology
  - Chemistry
  - Junior Science
  - Physics

## I do not have much time for the above, but I find it interesting. Is there something that I can do?

{% details Click here to know %}

- Yes! You could spread the message, only if you find it worth doing and willing to do so, by 
  - sharing the link [{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/),
  - and suggeting to go through the homepage [{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/), to find what all this is about!
