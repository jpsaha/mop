## Some of the [suggestions](https://web.evanchen.cc/faq-contest.html#C-0) from [Evan Chen](https://web.evanchen.cc/) regarding the preparation of Math Olympiad. 

> * Pick up any standard textbook to work through, so you learn some of the standard theory that is tested in math contests. 
> * Go through some past problems from previous contests. 
> * Rope some friends into learning with you. It’s more fun that way, and you can learn from each other. 
> * You should repeat these steps until you have some comfort with the kinds of problems that appear.
> * As you get experience, you will automatically start to know what deep understanding feels like. 
> * Be aware that you will see many, many problems which you can’t solve, where you read the solution and ask, “how was I supposed to think of that?”. This is okay and expected: it’s not because you’re dumb, it’s because you are learning.

## [A few training programs]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/Resources/)

#### The [OTIS program](https://web.evanchen.cc/otis.html)
  * Olympiad Training for Individual Study, run by [Evan Chen](https://web.evanchen.cc/) and [people](https://web.evanchen.cc/otis.html#people), is **a proof-based olympiad training program, with [over 600 students](https://web.evanchen.cc/upload/public-CV.pdf) per year from across the world**.
  * [Sunaina Pati](https://www.cmi.ac.in/people/student-profile.php?id=sunaina.ug2023), who [received](https://www.egmo.org/people/person2282/) a Silver medal in [EGMO 2023](https://www.egmo.org/egmos/egmo12/), remarked the following in a post discussing [How to start with Math olympiads](https://www.omath.club/2022/03/how%20to%20start%20with%20math%20olympiads.html).
   > Do join OTIS! It is simply so good. Evan is also very kind with financial aid. Moreover, do not be scared of applying! And if there is some financial burden, do tell to Evan.
  * In [an interview with the Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/parenting/moments/rushil-mathur-3-time-math-olympiad-awardee-on-how-to-become-a-maths-genius/articleshow/111488430.cms), [Rushil Mathur](https://www.imo-official.org/participant_r.aspx?id=34562) remarked the following.
    > The OTIS program run by Evan Chen is also a wonderful forum with a variety of different resources for Olympiad preparation.

#### [The Sophie Fellowship](https://www.sophiefellowship.in/home)
  * It is a training program and fellowship for students preparing for IMO, EGMO, INMO and other national and international mathematical competitions.
  * It is a student-run initiative to assist selected high schoolers passionate about mathematics, by offering help from people who have performed well at various mathematical contests such as the IMO, APMO, EGMO, and INMO.
  * The program will be completely free of cost.
  * It is run by a bunch of students who really like math and want to spread it further in the country. They aim to improve the quality of math education in India by making Olympiad math more accessible, as well as improve the gender ratio in the mathematical community.
  * The [team](https://www.sophiefellowship.in/team) consists of many IMO and EGMO medalists, as well as others who have attended the Indian IMO training camp. They have previously participated in Olympiads, we understand the challenges students in the math community face and want to help them. 
  * [Sunaina Pati](https://www.cmi.ac.in/people/student-profile.php?id=sunaina.ug2023), who [received](https://www.egmo.org/people/person2282/) a Silver medal in [EGMO 2023](https://www.egmo.org/egmos/egmo12/), remarked the following in a post discussing [How to start with Math olympiads](https://www.omath.club/2022/03/how%20to%20start%20with%20math%20olympiads.html).

> The Online Math Club is an initiative to reach high school students interested in math and give them a platform to learn more and interact with others. The Club aims to increase exposure to olympiad mathematics and advanced mathematics. And OMC is free and open to all!
* The [Online Math Club 2.0](https://sites.google.com/view/online-math-club/home?authuser=0) is a student-run mathematical program that aims to help students from all over India and internationally prepare for mathematical olympiads. The team consists of a group of math enthusiasts who have taken part in these math olympiads in the past, many of whom are also IMO and EGMO medallists and awardees from the Indian National Mathematical Olympiad. The classes run on a Discord server.
  * There are weekly olympiad mathematics sessions on each Saturday and Sunday. Through these classes, a wide range of olympiad mathematical topics are covered that are required for RMO and INMO preparation in each of Combinatorics, Geometry, Number Theory and Algebra, starting from the basics and building up to several advanced topics over the course of the year. [This page](https://sites.google.com/view/online-math-club/overview?authuser=0) contains further details.
