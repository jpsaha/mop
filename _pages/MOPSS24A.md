  * The Department of Mathematics, IISER Bhopal, would be organizing a series of Mathematics Olympiad Problem Solving Sessions (MOPSS). 
  * The aim is to develop an interest in mathematics among the students by encouraging them to work on problems falling broadly within the scope of the Mathematical Olympiad.
  
  > - The plan for [MOPSS]() is spread across the **following 9 dates**. The sessions will be held **during 9:00am to 12:00pm at IISER Bhopal in person offline classroom meetings**. The venue for these sessions is the [Multimedia Classroom](https://cs2.iiserb.ac.in/multimedia_classroom.php), on the first floor of the building AB1-B, at [IISER Bhopal](https://www.iiserb.ac.in/).

## Why math olympiads are a valuable experience for high schoolers

{% details Click here to know more %}
* The post by Evan Chen on [Lessons from math olympiads](https://blog.evanchen.cc/2018/01/05/lessons-from-math-olympiads/) is worth reading.
* In a previous post, titled [Against the “Research vs. Olympiads” Mantra](https://blog.evanchen.cc/2016/08/13/against-the-research-vs-olympiads-mantra/), Evan Chen discussed why math olympiads should not be judged by their relevance to research mathematics. He mentions that in that post, he failed to actually explain why he thinks math olympiads are a valuable experience for high schoolers. In the post [Lessons from math olympiads](https://blog.evanchen.cc/2018/01/05/lessons-from-math-olympiads/), he puts the amends. 
* and the last, but not the least, could be to take a look at the following [vision](https://imof.co/) of the [IMO Foundation](https://imof.co/), which is a charity supporting the International Mathematical Olympiad ([IMO](https://www.imo-official.org/)). 
> It is the aim of the IMO to bring young people together from all over the world to enjoy the challenges of mathematics in a spirit of friendly competition. This provides a stimulus for Mathematics in each of the participating countries as young people strive for selection. Whist clearly it is a competitive event, for most participants, it is the people that they meet and the shared joy of discovery that is what they regard as most worthwhile. It is common that lifelong friendships are forged at IMO events.
