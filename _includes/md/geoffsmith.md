>The nations which do consistently well at this competition (IMO) must have at least one (and probably at least two) of the following attributes:
> * A large population.
> * A significant proportion of its population in receipt of a good education.
> * A well-organized training infrastructure to support mathematics competitions.
> * A culture which values intellectual achievement.

> Alternatively, you need a cloning facility and a relaxed regulatory framework.

#### Here is an excerpt from his [Advice for young mathematicians](https://web.archive.org/web/20250124090959/https://people.bath.ac.uk/masgcs/advice.html).

> From time to time I am approached by students interested in advice about becoming more effective contestants in mathematics olympiads. Here it is.

> Do lots and lots, and then more, past papers. Begin with national mathematical olympiads, starting with the less difficult papers. Now, I am not going to risk insulting any countries by saying that their national maths olympiads are easy. Work it out for yourself. Countries which have small populations, and no great tradition of success in maths competitions, will generally have easier questions. When you become very good at those, then move on to hard national maths olympiad problems and the less demanding international competitions.

> I am often approached by students from **developing countries**. Sometimes students complain that *there is no satisfactory educational or training regime in my country*. Please check that this is true! The [IMO contact person](http://www.imo-official.org/countries.aspx) in your country may tell you otherwise. In the worst case, where there is no competent organization providing free (or nearly free) assistance to young mathematicians, then you will have to help yourself. Try to locate other young people in your country who are interested in mathematics, and work together. Fortunately there is a vast collection of free resources on the internet: over 25 thousand past problems from maths competitions are available at the extensive Art of Problem Solving site, and if you explore, you will find discussions of solutions. Don't look up the solutions too quickly (be prepared to spend many hours thinking about each problem). If you want to start on some problems which are less demanding than a full national maths olympiad, here are plenty of [British Maths Olympiad](https://bmos.ukmt.org.uk/home/bmolot.pdf) round 1 problems. The round 2 problems are more challenging.
