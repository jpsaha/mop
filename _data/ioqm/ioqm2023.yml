      - Note that $$ x \neq 1 $$ and $$ x - 1 $$ divides $$ 2 $$. It follows that $$ x = 2 $$ or $$ x = 3 $$.

      - If $$ x = 3 $$, then $$ y^3 = 23 + \frac 12 (3^4 + 1) = 23 + 41 = 64 $$, which gives $$ y = 4 $$.

      Let $$ X $$ be the set of all even positive integers $$ n $$ such that

      Find the number of triples $$ (a, b, c) $$ of positive integers such that

    watru: >
      - Suppose $$ (a, b, c) $$ is a pair satisfying the above conditions. 
      
      - Since $$ ab $$ is a prime, it follows that one of $$ a $$, $$ b $$ is equal to $$ 1 $$,
      and the remaining one is a prime. 
      
      - If $$ a = 1 $$, then $$ b, c $$ are distinct primes. 
      
      - If $$ b = 1 $$, then $$ c $$ is the product of two distinct primes which are

      This may suggest that


      $$
      a_n^2 - a_{n-1}a_{n+1}
      = 7^n
      $$


      holds for any integer $$ n\geq 1 $$. 

      
      - Indeed, 
      it is clear for $$ n = 1 $$. 
      Assuming that 

      \\[
      a_n^2 - a_{n-1}a_{n+1}
      = 7^n
      \\]

      holds for some integer $$ n\geq 1 $$, 
      note that

            & = a_{n+1}^2 + 4a_n a_{n+1} + 7 a_n^2 \\
            & = a_{n+1}^2 + 4a_n a_{n+1} + 7 a_{n-1}a_{n+1} + 7^{n+1} \\
            & = a_{n+1} (a_{n+1} + 4a_n + 7a_{n-1}) + 7^{n+1}\\
            & = 7^{n+1}.
      \end{align*}
      $$


      This proves that

      \\[
      a_n^2 - a_{n-1}a_{n+1}
      = 7^n
      \\]

      holds for any integer $$ n\geq 1 $$.  

      -
      Consequently, 

      \\[
      a_{50}^2 - a_{49}a_{51} 
      = 
      7^{50},
      \\]

      whose number of positive integer divisors is equal to 
      $$ 51 $$.

      A positive integer $$ m $$ has the property that $$ m^2 $$

      Since $$ n $$ is an integer, the discriminant of the 
      quadratic polynomial $$ 4n^2 - 5n + (16 - m^2) $$ 
      in $$ n $$ is a perfect square, that is, 
      there exists an integer $$ \ell $$ such that

      or equivalently,

      \\[(4m - \ell)(4m + \ell) = 3 \cdot 7 \cdot 11.\\]

      - 
      Note that $$ 4m-\ell, 4m + \ell $$ are odd and hence congruent to 
      $$ 1, -1 $$ modulo $$ 4 $$ (in some order). 
      Also note that 
      $$ 4m - \ell < 4m + \ell $$ holds.

      and consequently, 
      $$ 8m = 232, 80, 40, 32 $$, 
      which yields 
      $$ m = 29, 10, 5, 4 $$.

      If $$ m = 29 $$,

      If $$ m = 10 $$, then 
      $$ 4n^2 - 5n  - 84 = 0 $$
      holds,

      If $$ m = 5 $$,
