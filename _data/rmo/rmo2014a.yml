      Is it possible to write the numbers $$ 17, 18, 19, \dots, 32 $$ in a 
      $$ 4\times 4 $$ grid of unit squares with one number in each square such that 
      if the grid is divided into four $$ 2\times 2 $$ subgrids of unit squares, 
      then the product of numbers in each of the subgrids divisible by $$ 16 $$?

      Show that the product of the entries in 
      some subgrid is divisible by $$ 32 $$.
      
      - 
      Conclude that the product of all the $$ 16 $$ entries 
      is divisible by $$ 16 \times 16 \times 16 \times 32 $$.
      
      - 
      Is the product of the integers $$ 17, 18, \dots, 32 $$ 
      divisible by $$ 16 \times 16 \times 16 \times 32 $$?
    soln: >
      The highest exponents of $$ 2 $$ dividing $$ 32! $$ and $$ 16! $$ are given by
      \\[
          v_2 (32!) = 16 + 8 + 4 + 2+ 1, \quad
      v_2(16!) = 8 + 4+ 2+ 1.
      \\]
      So the highest power of $$ 2 $$ dividing the product of 
      the integers 
      $$ 17, 18, 19, \dots, 32 $$ is $$ 2^{16} $$. 
      Now if it were possible to write these numbers in a 
      $$ 4\times 4 $$ grid in the above-mentioned manner, 
      then the product of the numbers in each of 
      the $$ 2 \times 2 $$ subgrids with blue boundary 
      (see Fig. 1) 
      would be divisible by $$ 2^4 $$. Note that one such subgrid would contain $$ 32 $$, 
      which implies that the product of $$ 17, 18, \dots, 32 $$ is divisible by 
      $$ 2^4\cdot 2^4\cdot 2^4 \cdot 32 = 2^{17} $$, which is impossible. 
      Hence it is not possible to write the integers 
      $$ 17, 18, \dots, 32 $$ in a $$ 4\times 4 $$ grid satisfying the given conditions.
