      Is it possible to write the numbers $$ 17, 18, 19, \dots, 32 $$ in a 
      $$ 4\times 4 $$ grid of unit squares with one number in each square such that 
      if the grid is divided into four $$ 2\times 2 $$ subgrids of unit squares, 
      then the product of numbers in each of the subgrids divisible by $$ 16 $$?

      Show that the product of the entries in 
      some subgrid is divisible by $$ 32 $$.
      
      - 
      Conclude that the product of all the $$ 16 $$ entries 
      is divisible by $$ 16 \times 16 \times 16 \times 32 $$.
      
      - 
      Is the product of the integers $$ 17, 18, \dots, 32 $$ 
      divisible by $$ 16 \times 16 \times 16 \times 32 $$?
