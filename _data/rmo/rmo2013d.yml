      Suppose that the vertices of a regular polygon of $$ 20 $$ sides 
      are coloured with three colors red, blue and green, 
      such that there are exactly three red vertices. 
      Prove that there are three vertices $$ A,B,C $$ of the polygon 
      having the same colour such that triangle $$ ABC $$ is isosceles.

      Decompose the set of vertices of the $$ 20 $$-gon 
      using the vertices of the pentagons as in the image below.

      Since there are exactly three red vertices and 
      any of the remaining $$ 17 $$ vertices are blue or green,
      it follows that at least $$ 9 $$ of these $$ 17 $$ vertices 
      are of the same color, say blue. 
      Note that the set of vertices of 
      a regular $$ 20 $$-gon can be written 
      as the union of the four pairwise disjoint sets, 
      each of them consisting of the vertices of a regular pentagon
      (as in Fig. 1). 
      Since there are nine blue vertices, 
      by the pigeonhole principle, 
      at least one of these four sets contains 
      three blue points. 
      Since any three points on a regular pentagon form 
      the vertices of an isosceles triangle, 
      the statement follows.
