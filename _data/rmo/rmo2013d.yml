      Suppose that the vertices of a regular polygon of $$ 20 $$ sides 
      are coloured with three colors red, blue and green, 
      such that there are exactly three red vertices. 
      Prove that there are three vertices $$ A,B,C $$ of the polygon 
      having the same colour such that triangle $$ ABC $$ is isosceles.
