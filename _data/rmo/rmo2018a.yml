      Let $$ E $$ denote the set of $$ 25 $$ points $$ (m, n) $$ in the $$ xy $$-plane, 
      where $$ m, n $$ are natural numbers, $$ 1 \leq m \leq 5, 1 \leq n \leq 5 $$. 
      Suppose the points of $$ E $$ are arbitrarily coloured using two colours, red and blue. 
      Show that there always exist four points in the set $$ E $$ of the form 
      $$ (a,b), (a+k,b), (a+k,b+k), (a,b+k) $$ for some positive integer $$ k $$ 
      such that at least three of these four points have the same colour. 
      (That is, there always exist four points in the set $$ E $$ which form 
      the vertices of a square and having at least three points of the same colour.)

      Assume that the conclusion is false, 
      and 
      by interchanging the colors (if necessary), assume
      that there are more red points than the blue ones. 
      
      - 
      Show that one of the four corners is red, 
      and assume without loss of generality 
      that the point $$ E $$ is red.
      
      -
      Considering the number of red points in each of the 
      sets $$ \{A, A'\} $$, $$ \{B, B'\} $$, $$ \{C, C'\} $$, $$ \{D, D'\} $$, 
      prove that 
      these four sets together contain at most $$ 4 $$ red points,
      and conclude that 
      the green square
      contains at least $$ 8 $$ red points.
      
      -
      Consider the blue squares in 
      the green square, to show that 
      the green square contains exactly $$ 8 $$ red points.
      
      - 
      Conclude that there are exactly $$ 13 $$ red points,
      and each of the sets $$ \{A, A'\} $$, $$ \{B, B'\} $$, $$ \{C, C'\} $$, $$ \{D, D'\} $$
      contains exactly one red point, 
      and the green square contains exactly $$ 8 $$ red points.

      For each point on the dashed diagonal,
      consider the square having this point and $$ E $$ as its vertices,
      to show that the points on the dashed diagonal are blue.
      
      -
      Note that each point within the green square
      lying outside the dashed diagonal,
      is a vertex of a square having 
      two of its remaining vertices on the dashed diagonal.
      Conclude that each such point is red.

      Obtain a contradiction 
      to conclude that the assmption is false.

      On the contrary, let us assume that 
      there is no axes-parallel square having 
      at least three vertices of the same color.

      Note that at least $$ 13 $$ among those 
      $$ 25 $$ points are of the same color. 
      Without loss of generality, 
      assume that those are red. 
      By our hypothesis, it follows that 
      among the four vertices at the corners, 
      there is at least one red vertex. 
      Without loss of generality[^rmo2018ap4],
      let us assume that the bottom-right vertex is red, 
      and denote this vertex by $$ E $$ (as in 
      Fig. 1).

      Note that each of the sets 
      $$ \{A, A'\}, \{B, B'\}, \{C, C'\}, \{D, D'\} $$ 
      (as in Fig. 1)
      contains at most one red point, 
      otherwise, we can form an axes-parallel square with 
      at least three vertices of the same color. 
      Consequently, 
      the green square (as in 
      Fig. 1) contains at least 
      $$ 13 - 5 = 8 $$ red points. 

      If the green square contains at least $$ 9 $$ 
      red points, then at least one of the four blue
      squares 
      (as in Fig. 1) 
      contains at least three red points, 
      which is not the case by our hypothesis. 
      Hence, the green square contains exactly $$ 8 $$ 
      red points. 
      Consequently, 
      there are precisely $$ 13 $$ red points 
      among the $$ 25 $$ points,
      and each of the sets 
      $$ \{A, A'\}, \{B, B'\}, \{C, C'\}, \{D, D'\} $$ 
      contains exactly one red point.

      For any given point on the dashed diagonal
      (as in Fig. 1),
      consider the square having this point and $$ E $$ as 
      the endpoints of one of its diagonals.
      Note that one of the other two vertices of this square
      is red.
      By our hypothesis, it follows that 
      all the points on the gray diagonal (as in 
      Fig. 1)
      are blue. 

      Note that each point within the green square
      lying outside the dashed diagonal,
      is a vertex of a square having 
      two of its remaining vertices on the dashed diagonal.
      This shows that all the points within the green square, 
      lying outside the gray diagonal, are red. 
      Hence, there exists an axes-parallel square, 
      all whose vertices are red. 
      This contradicts our hypothesis,
      and hence, it follows that 
      there exists an axes-parallel square having 
      at least three vertices of the same color.


      [^rmo2018ap4]: Convince 
      yourself that there is *indeed no loss of generality* in assuming so.
