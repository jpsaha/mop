        Let $$ (p_1, p_2, p_3, \dots , p_n, \dots) $$ be a sequence of primes,
        defined by $$ p_1 = 2 $$ and for $$ n \geq 1 $$, $$ p_{n+1} $$ is the 
        largest prime factor of $$ p_1p_2 \cdots p_n + 1 $$. 
        Prove that $$ p_n \neq 5 $$ for any $$ n $$.

        Show that $$ p_1 p_2 p_3 \cdots p_n + 1 $$ is odd for any $$ n \geq 1 $$, 
        and $$ p_n $$ is odd for any $$ n \geq 2 $$.
        Deduce that $$ p_1p_2p_3 \dots p_n + 1 $$ is not a multiple of $$ 3 $$.
        (If you are stuck, then does verifying this statement 
        for small values of $$ n $$ help?)
        - What can be said about the smallest prime divisor of $$ p_1p_2p_3 \dots p_n + 1 $$?
        - If it is a power of $$ 5 $$, then $$ p_1p_2p_3 \dots p_n $$ is divisible by $$ 4 $$.
        Arrive at a contradiction.

        Note that $$ p_1p_2 \dots p_n + 1 $$ is odd for any $$ n\geq 1 $$, 
        and hence $$ p_n $$ is odd for any $$ n\geq 2 $$.
        Since $$ p_1 = 2 $$ and $$ p_2 = 3 $$, it follows that 
        for any $$ n\geq 2 $$, 
        the integer $$ p_1p_2 \dots p_n + 1 $$ is not divisible by 
        any one of $$ 2 $$ and $$ 3 $$. 
        So the least prime divisor of $$ p_1p_2 \dots p_n + 1 $$ is at least $$ 5 $$ 
        for any $$ n\geq 2 $$. 
        If possible, suppose $$ 5 $$ is the largest prime divisor of 
        $$ p_1p_2 \dots p_n + 1 $$ for some integer $$ n\geq 2 $$. 
        This yields 
        \\[
            p_1p_2 \dots p_n + 1 = 5^k
        \\]
        for some $$ k\geq 1 $$.
        This implies that $$ 4 $$ divides $$ p_1p_2 \cdots p_n $$, 
        which is impossible since $$ p_1 = 2 $$, and $$ p_r $$ is odd for any
        integer $$ r \geq 2 $$.
        This shows that $$ p_{n+1} $$ is not equal to $$ 5 $$ for any integer $$ n\geq 2 $$. 
        Consequently, it follows that $$ p_n\neq 5 $$ for any integer $$ n\geq 1 $$.
