      Given a prime number $$ p $$ such that $$ 2p $$ is equal to the sum of the squares of 
      some four consecutive positive integers. Prove that $$ p-7 $$ is divisible by $$ 36 $$.

      Show that the sum of four consecutive squares is congruent to $$ 6 $$ modulo $$ 8 $$, 
      and conclude that $$ p \equiv 3 \bmod 4 $$.
      Considering congruence conditions modulo $$ 3 $$, 
      prove that the smallest of the four consecutive numbers is a multiple of $$ 3 $$.
      Deduce that the sum of the four consecutive squares is $$ 5 $$ modulo $$ 9 $$.
