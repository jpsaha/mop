      Prove that among any $$ 18 $$ consecutive three digit numbers there is at least one number which
      is divisible by the sum of its digits.

      - Show that one among any such consecutive integers is divisible by $$ 18 $$.

      - Prove that its sum of digits, is a multiple of $$ 9 $$, 
      and conclude that it is equal to one of $$ 9, 18, 27 $$.
      
      - Show that the sum of its digits is not $$ 27 $$.

      Note that among $$ 18 $$ consecutive three digit numbers, 
      there is an integer divisible by $$ 18 $$. Denote it by 
      $$ n = 100a + 10b + c $$ with $$ a, b, c $$ denoting integers lying between $$ 0 $$ and $$ 9 $$.
      It follows that $$ 9 $$ divides $$ n $$, and hence 
      $$ 9 $$ divides $$ a + b + c $$.
      This shows that $$ a+b+c $$ is equal to one of $$ 9, 18, 27 $$. 
      Note that $$ a + b + c = 27 $$ holds only if $$ n = 999 $$.
      Since $$ 18 $$ divides $$ n $$, 
      it follows that 
      $$ a + b + c \neq 27 $$, 
      and hence, $$ a + b + c $$ is equal to one of $$ 9, 18 $$.
      This proves that $$ a + b + c $$ divides $$ n $$.
