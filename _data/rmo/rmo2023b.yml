      Let $$ \mathbb{N} $$ be the set of all positive integers and 
      \\[
      S=\left\\{(a, b, c, d) \in \mathbb{N}^4: a^2+b^2+c^2=d^2\right\\}.
      \\]
      Find the largest positive integer $$ m $$ such that $$ m $$ divides $$ abcd $$ for all $$ (a, b, c, d) \in S $$.

      - Show that $$ (1, 2, 2, 3) $$ lies in $$ S $$, 
      and deduce that $$ m $$ divides $$ 12 $$.

      - Let $$ (a, b, c, d) $$ be an element of $$ S $$.
      Show that at least one of $$ a, b, c, d $$ 
      is divisible by $$ 3 $$, 
      and at least one of them is even.
      
      - Prove that if $$ d $$ is even, then at least one of $$ a, b, c $$ 
      is even, 
      and that if $$ d $$ is odd, then at least two of $$ a, b, c $$ are even.
      
      - Conclude that $$ m $$ is divisible by $$ 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 $$.
