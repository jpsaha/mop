      Consider a set of $$ 16 $$ points arranged in a $$ 4 \times 4 $$ square grid formation. 
      Prove that if any $$ 7 $$ of these points are coloured blue, 
      then there exists an isosceles right-angled triangle whose vertices are all blue.

      - Show that if the small square (as in Fig. 1) 
      does not contain a blue point, 
      then we are done.
      
      - It remains to consider the case when the small square 
      (as in Fig. 1) contains 
      at least one blue point.
      
      - Rotating the configuration about the center of the small square
      (if necessary), assume that the top-left vertex of the small square 
      (as in Fig. 1)
      is blue. 
      
      - Prove that the gray square contains at most three blue points. 

        - Consider the case when at least two blue points 
        lie on the bigger dashed circle.
        Show that 
        the smaller dashed circle does not contain any blue point, 
        in this case.
        Hence, the gray square contains at most three blue points.
        
        - Similarly, 
        if the smaller dashed circle contains at least two blue points, 
        then the gray square (as in Fig. 2) 
        contains at most three blue points.

      - It suffices to consider that each one of the red, purple, and green 
      $$ L $$-shapes, has at most one end-point which is blue (otherwise, 
      we are done).
      
      - Use the above to show that the bottom-right point
      (as in Fig. 2) is blue.
      
      - Consider the point at the bottom-right corner, 
      and the center of the gray square,
      and a blue end-point of an $$ L $$-shape,
      to show that these three points form the vertices of
      an isosceles triangle having the required properties.

      Note that the $$ 16 $$ points are the vertices 
      of the four squares as in Fig. 1. 
      If no vertex of the small square is blue, 
      then by the pigeonhole principle, 
      at least one of the remaining three squares
      has at least three blue vertices, 
      and hence 
      there exists an isosceles right-angled triangle
      with blue vertices. 

      Let us assume that the small square 
      (as in Fig. 1) has a blue vertex.
      Rotating the configuration about the center of the small square 
      (if necessary), we may and do assume that the top-left vertex of the 
      small square is blue. 
      Henceforth, on the contrary, 
      let us assume that there are no isosceles right-angled triangles
      with blue vertices.

      > **Claim.** The gray square (as in Fig. 1) 
          contains at most three blue points. 
          \
          \
         *Proof of the Claim.*  Note that the points within the gray square
          lies on the two dashed circles 
          (as in Fig. 1).
          Therefore, 
          to prove the Claim, it suffices to show that
          if one of the dashed circles
          (as in Fig. 1)
          contains at least two blue points,
          then the other dashed circle does not contain any blue point.\
          \
          If at least two blue points lie on 
          the bigger dashed circle, 
          then using the assumption, 
          it follows that no more blue points lies on it, 
          and hence these two blue points lie 
          along a diameter. 
          It follows that no blue point lies on the other dashed circle.
          \
          \
          If at least two blue points lie 
          on the smaller dashed circle, 
          then using a similar argument, it follows that 
          no blue point lies on the bigger dashed circle. 
          \
          \
          The Claim follows. 

      Note that if both the end-points of 
      one of the red, purple, and green $$ L $$-shapes
      (as in Fig. 2)
      are blue, then these points together with 
      the center of gray square form 
      the vertices of an isosceles right-angled triangle, 
      contradicting the assumption.
      Hence, each one of these three $$ L $$-shapes 
      has at most one end-point which is blue. 
      Since there are $$ 7 $$ blue points,
      using the Claim, it follows that the 
      bottom-right point is blue. 
      Note that the center of the gray square, 
      the bottom-right point, 
      and 
      a blue end-point of the *purple* $$ L $$-shape, 
      form the vertices of 
      a triangle having the required properties.
