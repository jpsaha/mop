      Find all $$ 6 $$-digit natural numbers $$ a_1 a_2 a_3 a_4 a_5 a_6 $$
      formed by using the digits $$ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 $$, once each 
      such that the number $$ a_1a_2 \dots a_k $$ is divisible by $$ k $$, 
      for $$ 1 \leq k \leq 6 $$.

      - Show that $$ a_2, a_4, a_6 $$ are equal to $$ 2, 4, 6 $$ in some order.

      - Prove that $$ a_5 = 5 $$, 
      and $$ a_1, a_3 $$ are equal to $$ 1, 3 $$ in some order.
      
      - Using that $$ 3 $$ divides $$ a_1 a_2 a_3 $$, 
      determine $$ a_2 $$.
      
      - Using the divisibility condition by $$ 4 $$, 
      show that $$ a_4 = 6 $$, and conclude that $$ a_6 = 4 $$.

      Since $$ a_1a_2, a_1a_2a_3a_4, a_1a_2a_3a_4a_5a_6 $$ are divisible by $$ 2 $$, 
      it follows that $$ a_2, a_4, a_6 $$ are even, 
      and hence they are equal to $$ 2, 4, 6 $$ in some order. 
      Using that $$ a_1a_2a_3a_4a_5 $$ is divisible by $$ 5 $$, 
      we get that $$ a_5 = 5 $$.
      So $$ a_1, a_3 $$ are equal to $$ 1, 3 $$ in some order. 
      Using that $$ a_1a_2a_3 $$ is a multiple of $$ 3 $$, 
      we obtain 
      \\[
          a_1+ a_2+ a_3\equiv 0 \bmod 3,
      \\]
      which yields 
      \\[
          a_2 \equiv 2 \bmod 3,
      \\]
      and hence, $$ a_2 = 2 $$ holds. 
      Note that $$ 1234, 3214 $$ are not divisible by $$ 4 $$.
      This shows that $$ a_4 = 6 $$, and hence $$ a_6 = 4 $$.
      It follows that 
      $$ a_1a_2a_3a_4a_5a_6 $$ is equal to $$ 321654 $$, or $$ 123654 $$. 
      Note that the integers $$ 321654, 123654 $$ satisfy the required conditions too.
      This proves that $$ 321654, 123654 $$ are precisely all the $$ 6 $$-digit numbers 
      satisfying the given condition.

      Let $$ A $$ be a set of $$ 16 $$ positive integers with the property that

      - Suppose $$ \mathcal{A} $$ is a set of $$ 16 $$ positive integers, 
      and assume that $$ \mathcal{A} $$ does not satisfy the conclusion of the problem, 
      that is, it is false that 
      **some two** *numbers in* $$ \mathcal{A} $$ **are not** *relatively prime.*
      In other words, $$ \mathcal{A} $$ has the property that 
      **any two** *numbers in* $$ \mathcal{A} $$ **are** *relatively prime.*

      - Prove that such a set $$ \mathcal{A} $$ 
      would fail to satisfy the given condition, 
      which states that 
      *the product of* **any two** *distinct elements of* $$ \mathcal{A} $$ *is smaller than* $$ 1994 $$.
      In other words, 
      show that

      Observe that the above argument shows that if a set of $$ 16 $$ positive integers 
      violates the conclusion of the problem, then it does not satisfy the given condition. 
      **Convince yourself** that **doing so does prove** that 
      if a set of $$ 16 $$ positive integers satisfy the given condition, 
      then **there is no way that** it would fail to satisfy the conclusion.


      Further, also **convince yourself** that 
      establishing that 
      the failure of the conclusion forces the failure of the given condition
      is **equivalent to** establishing that 
      the given condition implies the stated conclusion.


      > When there are more than one condition, the given conditions 
      are to be **considered together**, and the *failure of the* **totality** *of the given conditions*

      Note that if $$ n \geq 1 $$, and $$ a_1, \dots, a_n $$ are distinct and pairwise coprime 
      positive integers such that $$ a_i \geq 2 $$ for all $$ i $$, then 
      one of them admits a prime factor which is at least as large as 
      the $$ n $$-th prime.
      Indeed, for each $$ i $$, if we fix a prime divisor $$ p_i $$ of $$ a_i $$, 
      then using that $$ a_1, \dots, a_n $$ are pairwise coprime, 
      it follows that $$ p_1, \dots, p_n $$ are distinct primes, 
      and hence the largest among them is at least as large as the $$ n $$-th prime. 
      Consequently, if $$ n \geq 2 $$, and $$ a_1, \dots, a_n $$ are distinct and pairwise coprime 
      positive integers, then at least 
      $$ (n - 1) $$ of them are greater than $$ 1 $$, 
      and hence one of them is divisible by a prime at least as large as 
      the $$ (n-1) $$-st prime. 


      If possible, let us assume that the elements of $$ A $$ are pairwise coprime. 
      Hence, $$ A $$ contains an element $$ x $$ which is divisible by a prime 
      at least as large as the $$ 15 $$th prime. 
      Similarly, the set $$ A\setminus \{x\} $$ contains an element $$ y $$ which is divisible by a prime 
      at least as large as the $$ 14 $$th prime. 
      Since the $$ 14 $$th and $$ 15 $$th primes are $$ 43, 47 $$ respectively, 
      it follows that $$ x\geq 47, y \geq 43 $$, 
      and consequently, 
      \\[
          xy \geq 47 \cdot 43 = 2021 >1994,
      \\]
      which contradicts the hypothesis.
      This proves that there are two numbers $$ a $$ and $$ b $$ in $$ A $$ 
      which are not relatively prime.

      Note that the above problem is similar to the following 
      problem in spirit. 
    eg1: >
      For a set $$ A $$ of consisting of positive integers, 
      let $$ \ell(A) $$ denote the largest integer which can be expressed as the 
      product of two distinct elements of $$ A $$.
      What is the smallest element 
      of the 
      set which consists of the integers of the form $$ \ell(A) $$ 
      as $$ A $$ runs over the sets of size $$ 16 $$ and consisting of 
      positive integers?
    bogus: >
      Since $$ \ell(A) $$ is to be minimized as $$ A $$ runs over the sets 
      $$ 16 $$ pairwise coprime integers and $$ \ell(A) $$ denotes 
      the maximum of the products of 
      the pairs of elements of $$ A $$, 
      it follows that the minimum value of $$ \ell(A) $$ is achieved
      precisely when the elements of $$ A $$ are as small as possible.
      This shows that the minimum value of $$ \ell(A) $$ occurs when 
      \\[
          A = 
          \left\\{
              1, 2, 3, 5, 7,
              11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 
              29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 
              47
          \right\\}
          .
      \\]
      Hence, the minimum value of $$ \ell(A) $$ 
      is 
      $$ 43 * 47 = 2021 $$.
