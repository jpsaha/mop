      Let $$ n $$ be a positive integer and $$ p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n $$ 
      be $$ n $$ prime numbers all larger than $$ 5 $$ 
      such that $$ 6 $$ divides $$ p_1^2 + p_2^2 + \dots + p_n^2 $$. 
      Prove that $$ 6 $$ divides $$ n $$.

      Observe that any prime larger than $$ 5 $$ is congruent to $$ \pm 1 $$ modulo $$ 6 $$.

      Since $$ a_1a_2, a_1a_2a_3a_4, a_1a_2a_3a_4a_5a_6 $$ are divisible by $$ 2 $$, 
      it follows that $$ a_2, a_4, a_6 $$ are even, 
      and hence they are equal to $$ 2, 4, 6 $$ in some order. 
      Using that $$ a_1a_2a_3a_4a_5 $$ is divisible by $$ 5 $$, 
      we get that $$ a_5 = 5 $$.
      So $$ a_1, a_3 $$ are equal to $$ 1, 3 $$ in some order. 
      Using that $$ a_1a_2a_3 $$ is a multiple of $$ 3 $$, 
      we obtain 
      \\[
          a_1+ a_2+ a_3\equiv 0 \bmod 3,
      \\]
      which yields 
      \\[
          a_2 \equiv 2 \bmod 3,
      \\]
      and hence, $$ a_2 = 2 $$ holds. 
      Note that $$ 1234, 3214 $$ are not divisible by $$ 4 $$.
      This shows that $$ a_4 = 6 $$, and hence $$ a_6 = 4 $$.
      It follows that 
      $$ a_1a_2a_3a_4a_5a_6 $$ is equal to $$ 321654 $$, or $$ 123654 $$. 
      Note that the integers $$ 321654, 123654 $$ satisfy the required conditions too.
      This proves that $$ 321654, 123654 $$ are precisely all the $$ 6 $$-digit numbers 
      satisfying the given condition.
