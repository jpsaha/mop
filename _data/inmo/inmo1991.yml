      For any positive integer $$ n $$, let $$ S(n) $$ denote the number of ordered pairs $$ (x, y) $$ of positive integers for which 
      
      $$
      \frac 1x + \frac 1y = \frac 1n
      $$

      (for instance, $$ S(2) = 3 $$). Determine the set of positive integers $$ n $$ for which $$ S(n) = 5 $$.

      For positive integers $$ x, y $$,
      note that 
      \\[
          \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y} = \frac{1}{n}
      \\]
      holds if and only if 
      \\[
          (x - n)(y - n) = n^2
      \\]
      holds. 
      Observe that 
      if $$ x, y $$ are positive integers satisfying 
      the given equation, then $$ x > n $$ and $$ y > n $$ holds. 
      This shows that the solutions of the given equation 
      over the positive integers are in one-to-one correspondence 
      with the pairs of positive integers $$ (a, b) $$ such that $$ ab = n^2 $$, 
      through the map 
      \\[
          (a + n, b + n) \leftrightarrow (a, b).
      \\]
      Hence, the set of positive integers $$ n $$ satisfying $$ S(n) = 5 $$ 
      is equal to the set of positive integers $$ n $$ 
      such that $$ n^2 $$ has precisely $$ 5 $$ positive divisors.
      Note that any such integer $$ n $$ is larger than $$ 1 $$. 
      Writing $$ n $$ as a product of powers of distinct primes, 
      it follows that $$ n^2 $$ has precisely $$ 5 $$ positive divisors
      if and only if $$ n $$ is the square of a prime.
      Indeed, if $$ p_1, \dots, p_r $$ are distinct primes, 
      and $$ a_1, \dots, a_r $$ are positive integers, 
      then the integer $$ (p_1^{a_1} \dots p_r^{a_r})^2 $$ has 
      precisely $$ 5 $$ positive divisors if and only if 
      \\[
          (2a_1 + 1)(2a_2 + 1) \dots (2a_r + 1) = 5
      \\]
      holds, which is equivalent to 
      $$ r = 1, a_1 = 2 $$.
      This proves that
      the positive integers satisfying $$ S(n) = 5 $$ 
      are precisely the squares of the primes.
