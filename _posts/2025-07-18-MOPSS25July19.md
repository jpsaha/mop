  - Is the given equation equivalent to 
  
  \\(
  (x - N)(y - N) = N^2?
  \\)
  
  - Note that it suffices to show that 
  if $$ N^2 $$ has precisely $$ 2005 $$ positive divisors
  for some positive integer $$ N $$, 
  then $$ N $$ is a perfect square.
  - Note that $$ 2005 = 5 \cdot 401 $$.
  - Observe that $$ 401 $$ is a prime, and hence,
  all the prime factors of $$ 2005 $$ 
  are congruent to $$ 1 $$ modulo $$ 4 $$.

  that is, it is false that

  In other words, $$ \mathcal{A} $$ has the property that 
  **any two** *numbers in* $$ \mathcal{A} $$ **are** *relatively prime.*

  *the product of* **any two** *distinct elements of* $$ \mathcal{A} $$ *is smaller than* $$ 1994 $$.
